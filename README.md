# Blog App

A blogging app built with [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io/) for demonstration purposes. A tutorial on how to create this app from start to finish is coming soon.

### Getting Started

Clone or download the repo. Edit the urls in the `database.yml` file to match the location of where you downloaded the app. Then run:
```
$ buffalo setup
$ buffalo dev
```

If you now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, you should see the app.

### TODO

- [ ] Email users upon registering
- [ ] Tags for posts (Many-to-Many relationship)
- [ ] Add tests
